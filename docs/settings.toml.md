# settings.toml

This file stores all packwiz-gui configuration.
The settings are as follows:

`backend`: Which graphical backend to use. Backends switched by using different import statements (for PySimpleGUI).

`qttheme`/`tktheme`: Which theme to use. Look depends on which graphical backend is currently selected.

`usegit`: Whether to make git commits/init git repository when creating/modifying an instance.
