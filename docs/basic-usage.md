# Basic usage

## Running the script directly

1. Install dependencies. Very simple to do (read: [build.py](./build.py.md)).

2. Download `packwiz` and put in the **bin** folder. (link: [packwiz github page](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz#installation))

3. Clone the git repository and run the file using the command line/terminal (NEVER double click).

## Using a compiled binary

1. Download packwiz and put in the **bin** folder. (link: [packwiz github page](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz#installation))

2. Download the compiled binary (choose between `pyinstaller` or `cxfreeze`) from github actions or github releases.

3. Run it from the command line/terminal (NEVER double click).
