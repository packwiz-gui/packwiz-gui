# Windows

Ah yes, windoze.

Known windows differences:

1. packwiz-gui is less tested on windows, (obviously linux is superior) and may crash or not work properly. File a github issue.
2. Need to use `python` instead of `python3` on the command line if you don't use windows store python.

*Note: even though Windows is less supported, it doesn't mean we won't fix bugs for it ASAP*
