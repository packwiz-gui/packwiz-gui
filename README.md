# packwiz-gui


## Build Instructions

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/ExoPlant/packwiz-gui/`
2. Make the folder `bin` where you cloned the repository
3. Download the [packwiz](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz/) binary for the OS you're building for and put it in the `bin` folder you created. If it's Windows, name it `packwiz.exe`. If you downloaded the macOS or Linux binary, just name it `packwiz`.
4. Run the `main.py` file or zip the contents of the folder if you're going to send it elsewhere.
5. Enjoy!
